#Management(User management is the process of controlling which users are allowed to connect to the MySQL server and what permissions they have on each database. 
phpMyAdmin does not handle user management, rather it passes the username and password on to MySQL, 
which then determines whether a user is permitted to perform a particular action. Within phpMyAdmin, 
administrators have full control over creating users, viewing and editing privileges for existing users, and removing users.)
